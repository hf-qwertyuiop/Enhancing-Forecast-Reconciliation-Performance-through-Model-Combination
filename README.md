# Enhancing Forecast Reconciliation Performance through Model Combination
## Introduction

- `result1.pdf`: we report performance on different metrics, at different hierarchical levels.

In result2.pdf, we take the Labour dataset as an example, select the optimal lambda with different metrics, and report its performance on each metric at different levels.

In result3.jpg, we summarize the proportion of levels where our method achieves either the best or second-best performance.

In results4.xlsx, we report the result of our end-to-end approach at all hierarchical levels.
