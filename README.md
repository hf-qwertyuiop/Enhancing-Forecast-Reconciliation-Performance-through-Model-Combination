# Enhancing Forecast Reconciliation Performance through Model Combination
## Introduction

- `result1.pdf`: We present the performance of our method across different metrics at various hierarchical levels.

- `result2.pdf`: We take the Labour dataset as an example, select the optimal lambda with different metrics, and report its performance on each metric at different levels.

- `result3.jpg`: We summarize the proportion of levels where our method achieves either the best or second-best performance.

- `results4.xlsx`: We report the results of our end-to-end approach at all hierarchical levels.
